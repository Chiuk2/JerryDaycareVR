This project was inspired by one of the programming test questions from Squanchtendo. The question was "Take your favorite scene from Rick and Morty.  Walk through at a high level what gameplay systems would be needed to create it in a VR experience." The scene picked was the "The factory tint setting is always too high" scene from Season 2 Episode 2 - Mortynight Run. This was created in Unity using the Google Cardboard VR sdk, and was done in 2 days.
